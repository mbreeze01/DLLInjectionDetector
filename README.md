## Overview

DLL Injection Detector is a tool designed to detect and prevent DLL injection attacks on Windows systems. DLL injection is a common technique used by malicious software to execute code within the address space of another process. This can lead to various security risks, including unauthorized access to sensitive data and system compromise. Our goal is to provide a reliable solution to enhance system security and protect against these threats.

- **Process Scanning**: Regularly checks running processes for known injection patterns.
- **Signature-Based Detection**: Utilizes a database of known malicious DLLs to identify threats.

### Supported Platforms

- Windows 10
- Windows 8
- Windows 7

### Requirements

- .NET Framework 4.5 or higher
- Administrator privileges for installation
